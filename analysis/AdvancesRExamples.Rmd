This is my works through the excercises in Hadley Wickham's ['Advanced R'](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Rcpp.html#rcpp-intro) book.

```{r}

library(Rcpp)
library(RcppArmadillo)
library(RcppEigen)
library(inline)

```


We start with the Guess The function Round:


```{r}
Rcpp::sourceCpp('analysis/guessTheFunction.cpp')

a <- seq(1:100)
b <- sample(c(TRUE,FALSE),100,replace=TRUE)

f1(a) == mean(a)

f2(a) == cumsum(a)

f3(b) == (length(which(b)) > 0)

# f4 is a function that loops through a dataset and returns positive preditictiond from a model



```


```{r}



/*** R
set.seed(42)
X <- matrix(rnorm(4*4), 4, 4)
Z <- X %*% t(X)

getEigenValues(Z)
*/


```
